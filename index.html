			<p>My name is Daniel and I attend the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. I graduated from the University of Georgia with a bachelor's degree from the University of Georgia. </p>
			<p>Upon graduating in 2015, I started my career in retail management with Kohl's. After finishing a three month training program, I was placed in Athens, GA as an Assistant Store Manager. While at Kohl's, I oversaw a team of over 80 part-time and full-time employees while managing departments that totaled in over $10 million in yearly revenue. I utilized the business acumen skills I learned in my training to ensure steady improvement in sales while using my leadership skills to ensure a friendly and productive atmosphere for employees and customers.</p>

			<p>After two years of working at Kohl's, I realized I needed a career change. I thoroughly enjoyed my job and my coworkers, but in order to excel in my desired career field, I needed to find a career I was passionate about. In March 2016, I left my job at Kohl's and moved to Atlanta. I accepted an offer as an Account Coordinator at Equipment Management Group, a small firm that specializes in providing low-cost dumpsters and equipment to contractors.</p>
